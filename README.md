# Whiteboard
This is a proof of concept, where the application recognizes a white board and an easel pad and automatically captures images of them. Those images can then be sent to an OCR. In the actual environment the camera would be a head mounted one where the automatic capture would actually make sense. 
The application draws rectangles on some other things but they will be rejected.
